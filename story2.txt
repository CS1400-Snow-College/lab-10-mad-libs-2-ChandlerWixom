A Wolf had been::past-tense-verb too greedily, and a::noun had stuck crosswise in his throat. He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not::verb a thing. Naturally that was an::adjective state of affairs for a::adjective Wolf.
So away he::past-tense-verb to the::noun . He was sure that she, with her::adjective neck and bill, would easily be able to::verb the::noun and pull it out.
"I will reward you very handsomely," said the Wolf, "if you::verb that::noun out for me."
The Crane, as you can imagine, was very::adjective about putting her head in a Wolf's throat. But she was::past-tense-verb in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do.
When the Wolf felt that the::verb was gone, he started to::verb away.
"But what about my::noun !" called the Crane anxiously.
"What!" snarled the Wolf, whirling around. "Haven't you got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your::noun out of my::noun without snapping it off?"
